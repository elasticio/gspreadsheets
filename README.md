# Google Spreadsheets component

This is Google Spreadsheets component for the elastic.io platform.

Google Spreadsheets or [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) has become a powerful and feature rich online alternative to the majiority of traditional office accounting and statistics. According to Google: _With Google Sheets, you can create, edit, and collaborate wherever you are. For free_.

# How to install

Fork it and push it into your elastic.io workspace. Don't forget to specify the Application Key and Secret for OAuth authentication in component's environment variables. 

Following environment are required:
 - ``GOOGLE_APP_ID`` oauth App ID
 - ``GOOGLE_APP_SECRET`` oauth App Secret

To get these please use the Google Developers Console is available from https://console.developers.google.com.

# How to use

Within the Elastic.IO environment Google Spreadsheets **can be used both as a trigger and an action component**. 

> The description below is based on the initial state of the Google Spreadsheet component presented here. Any third party modification should also be documented for the consistency.

## Triggers

### Rows

The  **Rows** *trigger* reads the data in each row of a given Google Spreadsheet and passes it to the next stage of your integration flow. For example one of the often used integration flows, **Google Spreadsheets &#8594; Debitoor**, uses this very trigger. If you have the list of your products or customers you could use this integration flow to transfer them into the Debitoor to do the accounting. 

#### The process

In the beginning the system will read all the rows from a given Google Spreadsheet and process it further along your designed integration flow. It will also create an initial state of your spreadsheet, we call it a ***snapshot***, in order to have something to compare after your data is updated.

After the initial read, any further requests for update will be compared to this snapshot and if any changes are detected they will be passed along the integration flow as well. It is, therefore, imperative to provide a **readable spreadsheet** for a smooth integration.

#### What is a readable spreadsheet?

The nature of API that Elastic.IO uses to read the rows in Google Spreadsheets dictates the use of certain rules that it is useful to follow for a smooth integration of your data. In addition to the **Minimum Requirements** your spreadsheet must have:   

1. **No empty spaces** - This means no empty columns, no empty rows and no spaces or newlines after each record. The **reading process stops if it encounters empty columns or rows** since there is no way to know if there are new or more records afterwards.

2. **Only `STRING` values** - Your data will be processed as a `STRING` data type.

3. **No formula** - If you calculate the value of any field using a formula the system will only read the `VALUE` of that field and convert it into a `STRING` data type. 

4. **One sheet only** - Your Google Spreadsheet must contain **only one sheet**. Even if you insert a second one, it will be ignored by the system.

#### External and internal ID for each row

When any given row is processed by the system it receives a *unique name* or a unique ID so that it can be recognised by the system afterwards if you wish to make any changes to the values in that specific row.

> In our system the row number in the Google Spreadsheet is taken as a unique ID to process through the integration flow.

## Actions

### Add Row

Your integration flow can also *write* or **add a row** to the given Google Spreadsheet as an **action**. In this case your spreadsheet will be the ***target spreadsheet***.

To use **add row** action the Google Spreadsheet file which will be receiving new data must already be mapped using the Data Mapper. This means the target spreadsheet columns need to be assigned to the specific ```values``` which are expected from the components within the same integration flow that are sending the information.

> Please note that the system will write a new record using only a ``STRING`` data type.

## Recommendations

Here are some general recommendations to help you avoid potentially confusing cases where you might get unexpected results while using Google Spreadsheets connector.

### Spreadsheet Country Format

Depending on your Google Account settings your Google Drive and especially Google Spreadsheets would have some specific default formatting applicable to the Account Language/Country Setup in use. By default Google will assume US formatting which would mean not only the default currency is US Dollar ($) but also the date format will be of ```MM/DD/YYYY``` format not ```DD/MM/YYYY``` which is widely used in European and other countries.

### Google Spreadsheet default Language Settings

Please note if the data you are planning to write has values in different language/country formatting than your Google Spreadsheets then ***you are most likely*** to encounter unexpected results. 

Make sure to **change it to the desired one in the Google Spreadsheets in advance** by selecting ```File > Spreadsheet Settings ...``` menu of your Spreadsheet.

### Changing the Spreadsheet structure

> Do NOT change the Spreadsheet structure while your flow is active

If you make structural changes to the Google Spreadsheet while it is being used it will cause number of Errors and the flow will stop functioning properly.

Decide the structure of your spreadsheet file in advance and avoid making any structural changes during the integration. In particular avoid adding or removing additional columns since you would need to repeat the flow design process to properly map or link your changes.

If you still wish to change the structure of your Google Spreadsheet then follow these steps: 

1. **Stop the integration flow** if it is running;

2. Make your changes in the Google Spreadsheet;
 
3. **Go through the integration design stage again** to ensure that all columns in the modified spreadsheet are properly linked with required fields or values necessary to run your integration flow.
 
4. Activate the flow again.

### Inserting a row

> Do NOT insert a row between the records while your flow is active

If you insert a new row between existing structure the system would fail to recognise it as an update. Instead this will cause the system to loose the connection between the **unique IDs** and the records **since our unique ID is the row number**.

If you wish to insert a row between existing records then you **must first stop the integration flow** in your Dashboard and then proceed to make the changes in your Google Spreadsheets file. You can activate your flow after you made the necessary changes. However, we recommend not to insert a row between the records even if you have deactivated it.

> New inserted row will cause an additional data transfer

Avoid inserting a row in between the records during the integration since it would look different for the system. This **would trigger an additional data transfer** since not only the new inserted row will be regarded as a new record but **everything after the inserted row would be considered a new data**.
